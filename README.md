# IoT-Based Bus Occupancy Monitoring System  

## Overview  
This project implements an IoT-based system to monitor bus occupancy in real-time using TCRT5000 infrared sensors. The system tracks passenger movement, providing insights into occupancy trends and optimizing route management.  

## Features  
- **Passenger Counting:** Utilizes TCRT5000 infrared sensors to detect and count passengers entering and exiting the bus.  
- **Real-Time Monitoring:** Displays live occupancy data to help commuters and authorities manage capacity.  
- **Data Logging:** Stores passenger count data for analyzing peak hours and trends to improve fleet management.  
- **User-Friendly Interface:** A simple application that presents real-time occupancy data for better decision-making.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Hardware:** TCRT5000 infrared sensors, microcontroller (Arduino/Raspberry Pi)  
- **Software:** Embedded C/Python for data processing, database for logging, frontend for visualization  

## Benefits  
- Reduces overcrowding and improves passenger experience.  
- Enhances route efficiency and fleet management.  

- Provides data-driven insights for better transportation planning.  

## Future Improvements  
- Integration with GPS for location-based analytics.  
- Cloud-based storage for long-term data analysis.  
- AI-based predictive modeling for demand forecasting.
